FYPsweeper
==========

Simple, rather feature incomplete version of Minesweeper I made for a friend. Done in a couple of hours. Aim for this
project was to complete it as fast as possible, so the code is horribly unmodular, non commented, and with cyclomatic
complexity. Feel free to ask me how I'd improve it!

If you're missing a dll, be sure to google and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package 

Shout outs to Buttured and Yeezus.
